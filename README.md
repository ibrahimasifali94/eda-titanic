# Titanic EDA

**TL;DR:** Quick exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset — looking at survival rates by gender, class, and age.

## What’s inside
- Load Titanic dataset (from seaborn)
- Summary statistics of passengers
- Charts: survival by gender, survival by class, age distribution
- My PM insights at the bottom

## How to run
Open the notebook in Google Colab:

## Results
- Females survived at a much higher rate than males.
- First-class passengers had higher survival rates than third-class.
- Children (under 10) had slightly better survival chances.

## Next ideas
- Add more feature correlations (e.g., fare vs survival)
- Try logistic regression for a predictive model
- Make a dashboard version with Streamlit
